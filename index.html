    <h1>Australian Agriculture and Rainfall</h1>

    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        Australia’s agricultural sector operates under highly variable climatic conditions,
        where rainfall plays a pivotal role in determining crop productivity.
        In recent years, changing precipitation patterns and increasing climate volatility
        have raised concerns about the sustainability and resilience of agricultural systems.
      </p>

        <p>
          This map visualizes the spatial distribution of rainfall across Australia over the past three years.
          The colour indicates how wet each location was compared to its long-term historical average.
        </p>
        <p>
          We observe that <strong>northeastern and southeastern coastal regions</strong>, such as
          <strong>Queensland(QLD)</strong> and parts of <strong>New South Wales(NSW)</strong>,
          have experienced consistently high rainfall, both in absolute terms and relative to history.
          In contrast, <strong>central and western inland areas</strong>—notably parts of
          <strong>Western Australia(WA)</strong>, <strong>South Australia (SA)</strong>, and the
          <strong>Northern Territory (NT)</strong>—have remained <strong>exceptionally dry</strong>,
          with many locations falling in the lowest rainfall percentiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          This pattern underscores a key challenge for Australian agriculture:
          <strong>water availability is not only limited but also geographically concentrated</strong>.
          Regions with higher rainfall support more intensive and reliable farming, while drier inland zones face increasing
          exposure to drought risk and must rely more heavily on irrigation or drought-resistant practices.
          These disparities drive <strong>uneven agricultural productivity</strong> across the country and shape
          regional adaptation strategies.

          This boxplot visualizes how total rainfall varies across Australian states and territories over the past 36 months.
          The <strong>height of each box</strong> and the <strong>length of the whiskers</strong> reflect rainfall variability.
        </p>

        <p>
          States such as <strong></strong> and the <strong>NT</strong> show the
          widest interquartile ranges and extreme outliers, indicating high unpredictability. Conversely,
          <strong>VIC</strong> and <strong>SA</strong> exhibit more clustered distributions,
          suggesting more consistent rainfall patterns.
        </p>

        <p>
          Understanding regional rainfall variability helps identify areas that may face <strong>climate instability</strong>
          and informs strategies for crop selection, irrigation planning, and drought preparedness.

          This scatterplot explores the relationship between <strong>mean annual rainfall</strong> and 
          <strong>cereal yield (kg/ha)</strong> across countries in 2022. Each dot represents one country. 
          Vertical and horizontal dashed lines show the global average rainfall and yield respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there is some positive association between rainfall and cereal productivity, 
          the relationship is <strong>not strictly linear</strong>. Some countries achieve high yields with 
          moderate rainfall, suggesting that <strong>irrigation, technology, or crop selection</strong> 
          also play critical roles. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Australia</strong> stands out: despite receiving less than average rainfall, 
          it manages to maintain relatively high cereal yields. This indicates 
          <strong>efficient water management and farming practices</strong> in dry conditions.

        <h2 class="section-title">Time-Series Trends With Agricultural Indicators</h2>
        <div id="linechart" class="viz"></div>
      </div>

      <div class="pure-u-1-2 rain-desc">
        <p>
          This line chart compares <strong>Australia’s Food Access Index</strong> and <strong>Crop Output Index</strong>
          from <strong>2014 to 2022</strong>, revealing important dynamics in food production and availability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between 2014 and 2017, both indices remained relatively stable around the baseline (2014–2016 average = 100).
          A sharp increase in <strong>crop output</strong> occurred in 2017, followed by a significant decline during the
          <strong>COVID-19 period (2019–2020)</strong>, likely reflecting weather shocks, supply chain disruptions,
          and shifting demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notably, while crop output rebounded rapidly after 2020—reaching a new high in 2022—the <strong>Food Index</strong>
          rose more modestly. This divergence suggests that although agricultural production recovered strongly,
          improvements in food availability and access were <strong>slower and less consistent</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These trends highlight the importance of resilient food systems: <strong>high output alone does not guarantee
          equitable food access</strong>. Ensuring that gains in productivity translate into accessible, stable food
          supplies remains a key policy challenge.

        <h2 class="section-title">The Relationship Between Yield and Area</h2>
        <div id="linebar" class="viz"></div>
      </div>

      <div class="pure-u-1-2 rain-desc">
        <p>
          This chart compares Australia’s <strong>cereal production</strong> (in tonnes) with the <strong>total area used for cereal crops</strong> (in hectares) from 2014 to 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the area allocated to cereal farming has remained relatively stable throughout the decade—hovering around 18–20 million hectares—the total production volume has shown significant <strong>year-to-year fluctuations</strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, <strong>2017 and 2021–2023</strong> were peak years with production exceeding 50 million tonnes, highlighting periods of highly favourable growing conditions. In stark contrast, production <strong>plummeted in 2020</strong> to around 26 million tonnes, despite the planted area being similar. This stark drop underscores how external factors such as <strong>drought, floods, or economic disruptions</strong> (e.g. COVID-19) can heavily influence agricultural output.
        </p>
        <p>
          These variations suggest that while land availability is a steady resource, Australia’s cereal production remains vulnerable to <strong>climate shocks and supply chain pressures</strong>. Policymakers and farmers must plan for this variability to maintain food security and export reliability.
